# orchPlan.md

A local, file-based multi-agent coding orchestrator. This document is the
single source of truth for the project's design and scope. Other models and
contributors should read it end-to-end before proposing changes, and update
it in the same PR as any design-affecting change.

**Status:** design complete; substrate tasks (T-0001…T-0005), inbox
runtime substrate (T-0006), dispatcher (T-0007), subprocess runner
(T-0008), merge driver (T-0009), runtime CLI (T-0010), Docker sandbox
runner, external model wrapper scripts, and per-worktree ownership hooks
implemented and tested. Project-specific Docker image assets are now
configured and tested without requiring Docker during the unit suite.
Planner handoff ingestion now turns embedded plan task YAML into validated
pending tasks for dispatch. Worker completion handoffs now export review
diffs and dispatch critic review messages. Critic review handoffs now
route approve verdicts through MergeDriver integration, route
request_changes back to the worker (up to max_retries rounds), escalate
to blocked on retry exhaustion, and abandon on reject.

## 1. Goal & Scope

Given a git repo and a natural-language request, produce reviewed, tested,
merged commits on `main` with no human in the loop for the happy path, using
multiple specialized models coordinated locally.

**In scope (MVP):**
- Single-host execution, single repo, single `main` branch.
- One user request → one plan → N tasks → merges.
- Local filesystem + git + append-only logs as the only persistence.
- Serial execution by default; opt-in parallelism per plan.

**Out of scope (MVP):**
- Remote/distributed workers, multi-repo coordination.
- Web UI, dashboards, databases, message brokers.
- Auth between agents, multi-tenant isolation.
- Automatic dependency upgrades or migrations.

---

## 2. Stack (fixed)

| Role | Model | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | Claude Opus | Claude Code subagent; never edits source |
| Planner | Gemini | CLI subprocess |
| Critic | Gemini | CLI subprocess (separate invocation) |
| Worker | Codex GPT-5.5 | CLI subprocess inside a worktree |
| Integration reviewer | Codex GPT-5.5 | CLI subprocess against temp worktree |

Isolation: one `git worktree` per active worker task. No shared mutable state
besides the filesystem under `.orch/` and the git repo itself.

Command sandbox: task and integration commands run through the configured
Docker sandbox by default. The repo is mounted read-only at `/workspace`; the
active command working directory is mounted read-write over its matching path.
The default network mode is `none`.

## 4. Task Schema

JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) at `.orch/schemas/task.schema.json`. Required
fields and constraints:

- `id`: `^T-[0-9]{4}(-[a-z0-9-]+)?$`
- `objective`: ≤280 chars
- `owned_files`: ≥1 glob; the worker may only edit files matching these
- `forbidden_files`: globs the worker must never touch (overrides owned)
- `allowed_commands`: exact command strings the worker may run
- `acceptance_criteria[]`: each `{id, check, kind: command|file_exists|manual}`
- `dependencies[]`: other task ids that must be `merged` first
- `branch`: `^task/T-[0-9]{4}`
- `worktree_path`: under `.orch/worktrees/`
- `status`: one of `pending | planned | in_progress | self_review |
  critic_review | integration_review | ready_to_merge | merged | blocked |
  abandoned`
- `review_notes[]`: append-only `{author, timestamp, verdict, body}` where
  author ∈ {`gemini-critic`, `codex-integrator`, `claude-orchestrator`}

The schema is enforced on every write via `scripts/validate_task.py`.
Filled YAML example lives at `examples/task.example.yaml`.

---

## 5. Roles (summary; full prompts live in `.orch/config/prompts/`)

Each role has: purpose / allowed / forbidden / inputs / outputs / handoff /
escalation. Hard rules:

- **Claude orchestrator** never edits source. Writes only under `.orch/`.
  Owns scheduling, merges, escalation. Delegates by passing only
  `{task_id, task_yaml_path, worktree_path, role}` — no inline guidance.
- **Gemini planner** produces a single `plans/P-XXXX.md` with embedded task
  YAML blocks. Never writes into `.orch/tasks/` directly.
- **Gemini critic** reviews diffs against ACs and policies; never runs code.
  Auto-rejects diffs >800 added lines or >12 files (recommend split).
- **Codex worker** edits only inside its worktree, only paths matching
  `owned_files`, runs only `allowed_commands`. Never `--no-verify`, never
  installs deps unless authorized. Rejects flawed plans by setting
  `status=blocked` with a `risks[]` entry prefixed `PLAN_DEFECT:`.
- **Codex integration reviewer** merges branch into a temp worktree off
  fresh `main`, runs full suite. Never edits the worker's branch; never
  merges into `main` itself.

---

## 6. Lifecycle (state machine)

```
Intake → RepoInspection → Planning → PlanCritique → Decompose → Dispatch
       → WorkerExec → SelfReview → CriticReview → IntegrationReview
       → Merge → Done
```

Retry/failure transitions:
- `PlanCritique → Planning` on `request_changes`; `→ HumanEscalation` on reject.
- `CriticReview → WorkerExec` on `request_changes` (≤2 rounds; 3rd escalates).
- `IntegrationReview → WorkerExec` for rebase/fix; 2nd failure escalates.
- `WorkerExec → Dispatch` on transient crash (≤2 retries).
- `WorkerExec → Blocked` on impossible AC or `PLAN_DEFECT`.

---

## 7. Process Model

- Async event loop in the orchestrator watches `.orch/inbox/orchestrator/`.
  Subprocess invocations of Gemini/Codex are blocking inside async tasks.
- Decomposition: planner proposes, orchestrator commits.
- Scheduling: orchestrator only.
- Review: critic (vs plan) + integrator (vs `main`).
- Merge: orchestrator only.

Worker plan-rejection protocol (concrete):
1. Worker sets `status=blocked`.
2. Appends `risks[]` entry starting with `PLAN_DEFECT:`.
3. Posts `.orch/inbox/orchestrator/{task_id, action:"reject_plan",
   reason, suggested_owned_files[]}`.
4. Orchestrator must re-enter `Planning` before any further work on that task.

---

## 8. Parallel vs Serial

| Condition | Mode |
|---|---|
| Tasks share any `owned_files` glob | Serial |
| Tasks have a `dependencies[]` edge | Serial |
| Disjoint owned files, pure code, no codegen | Parallel |
| Touches `migrations/**` or generated files | Serial |
| >5 ready tasks | Parallel up to `max_workers` (default 2) |
| Sibling task got `request_changes` | Serial with that sibling |
| Integration review failed in last hour | Serial |

**MVP default: serial, one worker.** Parallelism opt-in via
`orchestrator.toml: max_workers`.

---

## 9. Merge Strategy

**Default:** export branch as patch, apply onto fresh integration branch off
`main`, run full suite, fast-forward `main` only on green.

```bash
git -C .orch/worktrees/$T format-patch main..$B --stdout > .orch/patches/$T.patch
git fetch origin main
git worktree add .orch/worktrees/_integration origin/main
cd .orch/worktrees/_integration && git checkout -b integrate/$T
git am --3way ../../patches/$T.patch
uv run pytest -q && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy .
cd ../../.. && git checkout main
git merge --no-ff -m "merge($T): <objective>" integrate/$T
git worktree remove .orch/worktrees/_integration
git worktree remove .orch/worktrees/$T
git branch -D $B integrate/$T
mv .orch/tasks/active/$T.yaml .orch/tasks/done/
```

On conflict: `git am --abort`, route back to `WorkerExec` with conflict
files in a `request_changes` review note. Worker rebases inside its own
worktree (`git rebase origin/main`). Two consecutive integration failures
on the same task escalate to human. The orchestrator never resolves
conflicts itself.

---

## 10. Failure Handling

| Failure | Detection | Retry | Rollback | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Worker crash | non-zero exit, no self-review note | ≤2 same YAML | `git reset --hard` | `status=blocked` after 2 |
| Invalid plan | schema fail / forbidden globs | 1 replan | discard YAML blocks | human after 1 |
| Merge conflict | `git am --3way` fails | 1 worker rebase | `git am --abort` | human after 1 |
| Flaky test | passes in worktree, fails in `_integration` | 1 re-run | none | mark in `risks[]`, human |
| Hallucinated path | pre-commit hook (path must match `owned_files` and exist or be created) | none | `git restore` | critic auto-rejects; 2nd → human |
| Dep install fail | exit code + `ResolutionImpossible` in stderr | none | revert lockfile | always human |
| Context exhaustion | truncation sentinel | 1 split attempt | none | human after 1 |
| Orchestrator interrupted | stale PID file on startup | resume, don't retry | leave worktrees | only on inconsistency |

Resume order on startup: (1) `.orch/config/*.toml`; (2)
`.orch/locks/orchestrator.pid` (clear stale flocks); (3) every YAML in
`.orch/tasks/active/`; (4) `.orch/inbox/orchestrator/` oldest-first;
(5) `git worktree list --porcelain` to reconcile. YAMLs + inbox are
authoritative; in-memory state is not.

---

## 11. What's Built vs What's Designed

**Designed only (this doc):** full autonomous critic/integrator handoffs and
complete failure escalation policy.

**Implemented runtime tasks:**
1. **T-0001 repo-skeleton** — `.orch/` tree + `.gitignore` + `README.md`.
2. **T-0002 task-schema** — schema, example, `scripts/validate_task.py`.
3. **T-0003 config-loader** — `orch.config` reads `orchestrator.toml` +
   `policies.toml` with defaults and validation.
4. **T-0004 task-store** — CRUD over `.orch/tasks/{pending,active,done}/`
   with flock pickup and schema validation on write.
5. **T-0005 worktree-manager** — create/destroy worktrees at
   `.orch/worktrees/<task_id>/` on branch `task/<task_id>`; refuse
   removal with unmerged commits.
6. **T-0006 inbox** — atomic write/read of `.orch/inbox/<role>/*.json`
   with ordering, explicit acknowledgement, and at-least-once delivery.
7. **T-0007 dispatcher** — pick the next ready pending task, respecting
   merged dependencies, active owned-file collisions, and `max_workers`;
   create its worktree, move its YAML to active, and post the worker handoff
   message.

**Implemented and tested:**
8. **T-0008 subprocess-runner**
   - Objective: Provide one local subprocess boundary for model CLIs and
     task acceptance commands.
   - Owned files: `orch/runner.py`, `tests/test_runner.py`, `docs/PLAN.md`.
   - Acceptance:
     - Exact-string command allowlists are enforced before spawning task
       commands.
     - `stdout` and `stderr` are captured under `.orch/logs/<role>/`.
     - Timeouts return a structured result and write a timeout note to
       stderr logs.
     - Runner refuses to execute with a working directory outside the repo
       root.

9. **T-0009 merge-driver**
   - Objective: Implement §9 happy-path patch export, integration worktree
     application, check execution, and final task transition as one structured
     merge API.
   - Owned files: `orch/merge.py`, `tests/test_merge.py`, `docs/PLAN.md`.
   - Acceptance:
     - Exports `main..task/<id>` to `.orch/patches/<id>.patch`.
     - Creates a fresh `_integration` worktree and `integrate/<id>` branch.
     - Applies patches with `git am --3way`, aborting and returning a conflict
       result on failure.
     - Runs configured full-suite commands through `orch.runner`.
     - On green, merges into `main`, moves the task YAML to `done/merged`, and
       removes integration and worker worktrees.

10. **T-0010 orch-run-cli**
    - Objective: Add an `orch` CLI that ties request submission, inbox polling,
      dispatch, subprocess execution, critic/integrator handoff, and resume
      reconciliation into one serial-by-default runtime loop.
    - Owned files: `orch/cli.py`, `orch/runtime.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`,
      `tests/test_runtime.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - `orch submit "<prompt>"` writes an append-only request file and posts
        an orchestrator inbox nudge.
      - `orch run --once` processes the oldest actionable inbox or dispatch
        event deterministically.
      - Startup reconciliation follows §10 resume order.
      - Runtime uses `T-0006` inbox, `T-0007` dispatcher, `T-0008` runner, and
        `T-0009` merge driver rather than duplicating those contracts.
11. **T-0011 docker-sandbox-runner**
    - Objective: Execute allowlisted commands inside Docker containers rather
      than directly on the host.
    - Owned files: `orch/runner.py`, `orch/config.py`,
      `.orch/config/orchestrator.toml`, `tests/test_runner.py`,
      `tests/test_config.py`, `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - Sandbox config declares Docker binary, image, container workdir, and
        network mode.
      - Docker runner preserves the existing exact command allowlist contract.
      - Repo root is mounted read-only while the command cwd is mounted
        read-write.
      - Docker command construction is tested without requiring Docker during
        the unit test suite.

12. **T-0012 external-model-wrappers**
    - Objective: Add thin role wrapper scripts for Gemini and Codex subprocess
      handoffs.
    - Owned files: `orch/model_wrapper.py`, `orch/wrapper_cli.py`,
      `orch/runner.py`, `tests/test_model_wrapper.py`, `pyproject.toml`,
      `README.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - Wrappers inject checked-in role prompts and artifact-path context.
      - Configured external CLI commands receive the composed prompt on stdin.
      - stdout and stderr are captured through the shared runner log contract.
      - JSON handoffs emitted by the model are posted to the durable inbox.
      - Console entry points exist for planner, critic, worker, and integrator
        roles.

13. **T-0013 worktree-ownership-hooks**
    - Objective: Install a local pre-commit hook in every worker worktree that
      enforces task `owned_files` and `forbidden_files` before commits.
    - Owned files: `orch/worktree.py`, `orch/dispatcher.py`,
      `orch/merge.py`, `tests/test_worktree.py`, `tests/test_dispatcher.py`,
      `README.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - Dispatch passes task ownership globs into worktree creation.
      - Worker worktrees use worktree-local `core.hooksPath` configuration.
      - The hook rejects staged paths outside `owned_files`.
      - The hook rejects staged paths matching `forbidden_files`, even if also
        owned.
      - Merge cleanup removes the task hook directory with the worker worktree.

14. **T-0014 project-sandbox-image**
    - Objective: Provide a project-specific Docker image definition and build
      command for sandboxed task and integration checks.
    - Owned files: `docker/orchestra-sandbox.Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`,
      `.orch/config/orchestrator.toml`, `orch/config.py`, `orch/images.py`,
      `orch/cli.py`, `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_images.py`,
      `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_runner.py`, `README.md`,
      `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - Sandbox config names the image tag, Dockerfile, and build context.
      - The project Dockerfile installs runtime and test dependencies.
      - `.dockerignore` excludes git, virtualenv, caches, and runtime
        orchestrator state from the build context.
      - `orch image build --print` emits the exact configured Docker build
        command without requiring Docker.
      - Image build command construction rejects configured paths outside the
        repo root.

15. **T-0015 planner-handoff-ingest**
    - Objective: Convert Gemini planner handoffs into validated pending task
      YAMLs that the existing dispatcher can run.
    - Owned files: `orch/plans.py`, `orch/runtime.py`,
      `tests/test_plans.py`, `tests/test_runtime.py`, `README.md`,
      `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - Runtime handles orchestrator inbox messages with
        `action: "planned"` and a repo-relative `plan_path`.
      - Markdown plan artifacts are scanned for fenced YAML task blocks.
      - Extracted tasks are schema-validated before any pending YAML is
        written.
      - Duplicate task ids and plan paths outside the repo are rejected.
      - After successful ingest, runtime dispatches through the existing
        dispatcher when worker capacity is available.

17. **T-0017 critic-review-ingest**
    - Objective: Route critic verdicts into the next lifecycle step: merge,
      worker rework, escalation, or abandonment.
    - Owned files: `orch/runtime.py`, `tests/test_runtime.py`, `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - Runtime handles orchestrator inbox messages with
        `action: "critic_reviewed"`, `task_id`, and `verdict`.
      - On `approve`: transitions to `integration_review`, calls
        `MergeDriver.merge_task()`, and returns `kind="merged"` on success.
      - On `approve` with integration failure: routes back to worker
        (`kind="merge_failed_reworking"`) or escalates to `blocked` after
        `max_retries` integration failures (`kind="escalated"`).
      - On `request_changes` within retry budget: appends review note,
        transitions task to `in_progress`, posts worker re-dispatch message
        (`kind="critic_rework_dispatched"`).
      - On `request_changes` at or beyond `max_retries` prior rounds:
        transitions task to `blocked` (`kind="escalated"`).
      - On `reject`: transitions task to `abandoned` (`kind="abandoned"`).
      - Malformed messages (missing task_id or invalid verdict) raise before
        ack, leaving the message for retry.

16. **T-0016 worker-critic-handoff**
    - Objective: Route completed worker branches into critic review using
      durable diff artifacts and inbox handoff messages.
    - Owned files: `orch/review.py`, `orch/runtime.py`,
      `tests/test_review.py`, `tests/test_runtime.py`, `README.md`,
      `docs/PLAN.md`.
    - Acceptance:
      - Runtime handles orchestrator inbox messages with
        `action: "worker_completed"` and `task_id`.
      - Review dispatch exports `main..task/<id>` to
        `.orch/patches/<id>.diff`.
      - Task status transitions to `critic_review`.
      - Critic inbox messages include only artifact paths and role metadata.
      - Malformed worker completion messages remain unacknowledged by failing
        before ack.

**Required external pieces (out of scope of T-0001…T-0017):**
- None for the local MVP substrate; real model CLI credentials and provider
  availability are environment-specific runtime concerns.

---

## 12. Tradeoffs Accepted by MVP

- Serial-by-default leaves throughput on the table for debuggability.
- File-based inbox + flock has no fairness guarantees; fine at 1–2 workers.
- No durable queue — small crash windows can leave inconsistent state;
  resume reconciliation handles it but the window exists.
- Single host, no auth between agents.
- Patch-based merge collapses worker-internal commits into one merge
  commit on `main` (intentional).
- Two-round critic cap will sometimes escalate hard tasks prematurely.
- Safety relies on the Docker daemon boundary; users with Docker access are
  effectively privileged on the host, so this is a practical isolation layer
  rather than a multi-tenant security boundary.
- No built-in cost/latency cap until `orchestrator.toml` budgets are added
  (max tasks per request, max wall-clock, max tokens) — do this before
  first real run.

---

## 13. How to Iterate on This Plan

- Treat §3 (layout), §4 (schema), §5 (role contracts), §9 (merge) as
  load-bearing. Changes here ripple through every task and require updating
  this doc in the same PR.
- §8 (parallelism) and §10 (failure policy) are tunable; change freely
  once T-0010 is running and there is real data.
- Next iterations should focus on a continuous `orch run` loop (multiple
  `run_once` calls), budget enforcement (max_tasks_per_request,
  max_wall_clock_minutes), and wiring the `codex-integrator` model wrapper
  as an optional pre-merge review step before `MergeDriver`.
- When in doubt: prefer fewer features, stricter contracts, more logs.
